## How it works

The game starts by asking you to choose a difficulty level. Depending on your choice, you will have 5 to 30 seconds to answer each question. If you don't answer in time, the question will be marked as wrong.

You will be asked 50 questions in total. You can quit at any time by typing 'quit'. If you answer a question correctly, your score increases. If you answer incorrectly or fail to answer in time, the question will be added to a list of questions you got wrong.

At the end of the game, you can review all the questions you got wrong. The game also updates your high score if you've beaten it.

In addition to the quiz, you can also review the times tables. You can choose which times table to review, and the game will display it for you.

## How to run

To run the game, simply execute the Python script in your terminal. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
